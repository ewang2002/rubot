# Rubot 2.0
A somewhat UCSD-oriented Discord bot named after a clown. 

## Features
Rubot does contain a variety of commands that UCSD students may find useful. For example, you can
-   see course information from the course catalog via the `/courseinfo` command.
-   get current enrollment counts and course offerings from WebReg via the `/lookuplive` and `/liveseats` commands.
-   see current and upcoming classes (including free classes) via `/allrooms`.
-   get basic enrollment history plots via `/overallplot` and `/sectionplot`.
-   get CAPE data via `/getcape`.

The live data and enrollment history plots come from [UCSDHistEnrollData](https://github.com/ewang2002/UCSDHistEnrollData)
and [webreg_scraper](https://github.com/ewang2002/webreg_scraper).
